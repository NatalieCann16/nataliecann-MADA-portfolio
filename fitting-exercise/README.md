# Fitting Exercise

There was a comment in the class instructions that said including README files is important. I was unsure if that was hinting that we need to include a README file for this exercise, so I will include a README file just to be safe in regards to my grade. 

In this exercise, I performed simple data processing/cleaning, EDA, and fitting of a few models to poorly defined data. (all seen in fitting-exercise.qmd)

I followed instructions specified on the course website page here: https://andreashandel.github.io/MADAcourse/content/model-fitting/assessment-model-fitting.html

The data used in this exercise can be found here: https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/BayesPBPK-tutorial

I downloaded the data file called "Mavoglurant_A2121_nmpk.csv".
