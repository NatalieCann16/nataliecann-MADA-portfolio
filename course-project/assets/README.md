# Assets

This folder contains all static content from outside sources which is
neither code nor generated by code. 

This includes, but is not limited to, workflow schematics generated from biorender, other images taken from outside sources, `csl` files, `bib` files, pdf files of references, etc.

This folder contains the `references` subfolder. 
It is recommended to useeither the more explicit (Author, year) format (as e.g. implemented in `vancouver-author-date`) or the more concise [#] format that just shows numbers (as e.g. implemented in `american-journal-of-epidemiology.csl`). You can download many more reference style files from here:
