# Supplementary Results

Table one displays a summary of each variable of the COVID-19 vaccine dataset. 

```{r}
#| label: Summary Statistics
#| fig-cap: "Supplement Table 1: Summary Statistics of the Vaccination Data in Original Dataset and Population Adjusted Dataset"
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable1 = readRDS(here("course-project", "results","tables","summary_statistics.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable1)
```

Figure one displays the correlations between all variables within the COVID-19 vaccine population adjusted dataset. 

```{r}
#| label: Overall Correlation Plot
#| fig-cap: "Supplement Figure 1: Overall Correlation Plot of COVID-19 Vaccine Data"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("course-project", "results", "figures", "overall_corrplot.png"))
```

Figure two shows the correlations of specifically the distribution and administration variables in the dataset. The correlation between total_administered and total_distributed is 0.89; the correlation between total_admin_janssen and total_dist_janssen is 0.96; the correlation between total_admin_moderna and total_dist_moderna is 0.87; the correlation between total_admin_pfizer and total_dist_pfizer is 0.90; the correlation between total_admin_novavax and total_dist_novavax is 0.90, which is the lowest of all manufacturers; and the correlation between total_admin_unk and total_dist_unk is -0.01. The distributed and administered unknown variables are likely a part of this dataset due to poor data recording. 

```{r}
#| label: Distribution and Administration Correlation Plot
#| fig-cap: "Supplement Figure 2: Correlation Plot of Distributed vs. Administrated COVID-19 Vaccine Data"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("course-project", "results", "figures", "corrplot_dist_admin.png"))
```

Below, you will several scatterplots. Figure three is an overall scatterplot of the relationship between administered and distributed doses. The points closely follow the diagonal line, indicating a strong relationship between the two variables (confirmed by the correlation coeffecient of 0.89). 

```{r}
#| label: Scatterplot of Distributed vs Administered Doses
#| fig-cap: "Supplement Figure 3: Scatterplot of Distributed vs Administered Doses "
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("course-project", "results","figures","scatterplot_dist_admin.png"))
```

Figures 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, and 4.2 show the scatterplots of the relationship between administered and distributed doses for each vaccine manufacturer. It appears as though all regions have a strong positive correlation between the number of vaccines distributed and administered. However, Pfizer and Moderna's points still follow the diagonal line the closest. 

```{r}
#| label: Scatterplot of Distributed vs Administered Moderna Doses 
#| fig-cap: "Supplement Figure 4.1: Scatterplot of Distributed vs Administered Moderna Doses"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("course-project", "results","figures","scatterplot_dist_admin_moderna.png"))
```

```{r}
#| label: Scatterplot of Distributed vs Administered Janssen Doses 
#| fig-cap: "Supplement Figure 4.2: Scatterplot of Distributed vs Administered Janssen Doses"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("course-project", "results","figures","scatterplot_dist_admin_janssen.png"))
```

```{r}
#| label: Scatterplot of Distributed vs Administered Pfizer Doses 
#| fig-cap: "Supplement Figure 4.3: Scatterplot of Distributed vs Administered Pfizer Doses"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("course-project", "results","figures","scatterplot_dist_admin_pfizer.png"))
```

```{r}
#| label: Scatterplot of Distributed vs Administered Novavax Doses 
#| fig-cap: "Supplement Figure 4.4: Scatterplot of Distributed vs Administered Novavax Doses"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("course-project", "results","figures","scatterplot_dist_admin_novavax.png"))
```

Figures 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4 show the scatterplots of the relationship between administered and distributed doses for each region of the U.S.. 

```{r}
#| label: Scatterplot of Distributed vs Administered Doses in the South 
#| fig-cap: "Supplement Figure 5.1: Scatterplot of Distributed vs Administered Doses in the South"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("course-project", "results","figures","scatterplot_dist_admin_south.png"))
```

```{r}
#| label: Scatterplot of Distributed vs Administered Doses in the Northeast 
#| fig-cap: "Supplement Figure 5.2: Scatterplot of Distributed vs Administered Doses in the Northeast"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("course-project", "results","figures","scatterplot_dist_admin_northeast.png"))
```

```{r}
#| label: Scatterplot of Distributed vs Administered Doses in the Midwest
#| fig-cap: "Supplement Figure 5.3: Scatterplot of Distributed vs Administered Doses in the Midwest"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("course-project", "results","figures","scatterplot_dist_admin_midwest.png"))
```

```{r}
#| label: Scatterplot of Distributed vs Administered Doses in the West
#| fig-cap: "Supplement Figure 5.4: Scatterplot of Distributed vs Administered Doses in the West"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("course-project", "results","figures","scatterplot_dist_admin_west.png"))
```

Table two shows the correlations between doses administered and distributed in each region of the U.S.. All four regions have high correlations, however the west is the highest. 

```{r}
#| label: Regional Correlations Between Doses Administered and Distributed
#| fig-cap: "Supplement Table 2: Regional Correlations Between Doses Administered and Distributed in Pouplation Adjusted Dataset"
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable2 = readRDS(here("course-project", "results","tables","correlation_by_region.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable2)
```

Table three shows the percent rate change in distribution and administration of the COVID-19 vaccine across time in each region of the U.S.. The drops depicted in figures 3 and 4 in the manuscript can be seen in this table by the large percent drops in doses administered and distributed. 

```{r}
#| label: Percent Rate Change in Distribution and Administration of COVID-19 Vaccine with time in each Region
#| fig-cap: "Supplement Table 3: Percent Rate Change in Distribution and Administration of COVID-19 Vaccine with time in each Region (in Population Adjusted Dataset)"
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable3 = readRDS(here("course-project", "results","tables","region_rate_change_adj.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable3)
```

Table 4.1 and 4.2 show the percent rate change in distribution (4.1) and administration (4.2) of the COVID-19 vaccine across time for each manufacturer. The drops depicted in figures 5 and 6 in the manuscript can be seen in this table by the large percent drops in doses administered and distributed. 

```{r}
#| label: Percent Rate Change in Distribution of COVID-19 Vaccine with time for each Manufacturer
#| fig-cap: "Supplement Table 4.1: Percent Rate Change in Distribution of COVID-19 Vaccine with time for each Manufacturer (in Population Adjusted Dataset)"
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable4_1 = readRDS(here("course-project", "results","tables","manuf_dist_rate_change_adj.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable4_1)
```

```{r}
#| label: Percent Rate Change in Administration of COVID-19 Vaccine with time for each Manufacturer
#| fig-cap: "Supplement Table 4.2: Percent Rate Change in Administration of COVID-19 Vaccine with time for each Manufacturer (in Population Adjusted Dataset)"
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable4_2 = readRDS(here("course-project", "results","tables","manuf_admin_rate_change_adj.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable4_2)
```

Table 5 shows the RMSE value of the null model (with no predictors) from the modeling analysis. The R-squared can be assumed to be 0 here. 

```{r}
#| label: Null Model RMSE
#| fig-cap: "Supplement Table 5: Null Model RMSE"
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable5 = readRDS(here("course-project", "results", "tables", "null_model_metrics.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable5)
```

Table 6 shows the Simple Linear Regression Metrics results from the modeling analysis. 

```{r}
#| label: Simple Linear Regression Metrics
#| fig-cap: "Supplement Table 6: Simple Linear Regression Metrics"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("course-project","results","tables","slr_metrics_table.png"))
```

An additional model (the random forest model including all predictors) was fitted to the test data out of curiosity. The metrics are shown in Table 7. 

```{r}
#| label: Original/All Predictors Random Forest Model Test Data Metrics
#| fig-cap: "Supplement Table 7: Original/All Predictors Random Forest Model Test Data Metrics"
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable5 = readRDS(here("course-project", "results", "tables", "orig_rf_model_test.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable5)
```

Figure 6 displays the corresponding observed vs predicted plot for this model when it was fitted to the test data. 

```{r}
#| label: Original/All Predictors Random Forest Model Observed vs Predicted (Test Data Fit)
#| fig-cap: "Supplement Figure 6: All Predictors Random Forest Model Observed vs Predicted (Test Data Fit)"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("course-project", "results","figures","orig_rf_model_test_plot.png"))
```
